                <p>Fred "Freddie/Freddy" Jones[3] is the leader of the Mystery Inc. gang, and (more often than not) the driver of their van: The Mystery Machine. Fred is statuesque and brave; everything that the group's other male human member, Shaggy Rogers, isn't.</p>

        <div class=d2>
             <h2>Personal Thoughts</h2>
                <p> Fred Jones is the leader and muscle of the Mytery Gang. He constantly runs head on to danger to protect his friends, although usually they are in danger because he used them as bait. He has average to above average deduction skills. For these reasons I would rate Fred Jones as an A tier member of the Mystery Gang.</p>
