                <p>Daphne Blake is a fictional character in the Scooby-Doo franchise. Daphne, depicted as coming from a wealthy family, is noted for her orange hair, lavender heels, fashion sense, and her knack for getting into danger, hence the nickname "Danger Prone Daphne". She has appeared in more adaptations than the other characters, aside from Shaggy Rogers and Scooby-Doo.</p>

            <h2>Personal Thoughts</h2>
                <p> Daphne is a very good driver with a lot of resources and money. She offers a lot of utility to the group in terms of constantly making discoveries, having convenient contancts and her credit card. She tends to not do much for the team most of the time, but always comes through in the clutch. For these reasons I would rate Velma as a B tier member of the Mystery Gang.
