            <p>Daphne Blake is a fictional character in the Scooby-Doo franchise. Daphne, depicted as coming from a wealthy family, is noted for her orange hair, lavender heels, fashion sense, and her knack for getting into danger, hence the nickname "Danger Prone Daphne". She has appeared in more adaptations than the other characters, aside from Shaggy Rogers and Scooby-Doo.</p>

            <h2>Personal Thoughts</h2>
            <p> I personally think of Velma as the intellectual leader of the group, she is the most proficient at finding and analyazing clues as well almost always being the person to reveal the monster's true identity. For these reasons I would rate Velma as an A tier member of the Mystery Gang.
