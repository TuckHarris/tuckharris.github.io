            <h2>Velma Dinkley</h2>
            <img src='img/velma.jpg' alt= 'Image of Velma Dinkely' Title= 'Velma Dinkely'/>
            <p>Velma Dinkley is a fictional character in the Scooby-Doo franchise.[1] She is usually seen wearing a baggy orange turtleneck, short red pleated skirt (or in later episodes an A-line skirt, or sometimes shorts), knee socks, Mary Jane shoes, and most prominently, a pair of square glasses, which she frequently loses. She is seen as the brains of the group.</p>

        <div class=d2>
            <h2>Personal Thoughts</h2>
            <p> I personally think of Velma as the intellectual leader of the group, she is the most proficient at finding and analyazing clues as well almost always being the person to reveal the monster's true identity. For these reasons I would rate Velma as an A tier member of the Mystery Gang.
