                <p>Scooby Doo is the eponymous character and protagonist of the animated television franchise of the same name created in 1969 by the American animation company Hanna-Barbera.[1] He is a male Great Dane and lifelong companion of amateur detective Shaggy Rogers, with whom he shares many personality traits. He features a mix of both canine and human behaviors (reminiscent of other funny animals in Hanna-Barbera's series), and is treated by his friends more or less as an equal. He speaks in a slurred, dog-like voice. His catchphrase is "Scooby-Dooby-Doo!" </p>

             <h2>Personal Thoughts</h2>
                <p> Scooby-Doo is best character to come out of fiction in the past 30 years. His catch-phrase is as famous as his name. Nuf said. For these reasons I would rate Scooby-Doo as an S tier member of the Mystery Gang. </p>
